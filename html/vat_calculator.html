The web form:
Normal web forms have an action and a metho. The action is where the form is sent (login.html for example), and the metho is the method to use; usually post.
Because we're going to override what happens when the form is submitted using JavaScript we don't need that.

<form id="InputForm">
<!--
Being more of a Python person than a HTML one I used the blow Python code to generate the form field:

from wtforms import Form, FloatField


class InputForm(Form):
    """A form with a signle field."""
    cost = FloatField(description='The value to calculate VAT for')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    f = InputForm()
    for field in f:
        print(f'<p>{field.label} {field}</p>')

-->
<p><label for="cost">Cost</label> <input id="cost" name="cost" type="text" value=""></p>
<p><input type="submit" value="Calculate VAT"></p>
</form>

/*
Always split your code up. Never write something twice because when you change
it (like the VAT value below) it is twice as hard to update your code, and
twice as error-prone.

We're going to use the const keyword to set this value, although of course we
could use var or let. The reason why I'll leave to you guys to figure out if
you plan to learn more JavaScript.
